## Introduction

Welcome to the Networking Basics #0 project! In this project, we will explore the fundamental concepts of networking to lay a solid foundation for understanding how data is transmitted over networks. We will cover topics like the OSI model, LAN, WAN, Internet, IP addresses, TCP/UDP protocols, ports, and more.

## Resources

Before diving into the project, it's essential to review some key resources to gain a better understanding of the concepts we'll be exploring:

- OSI model: Learn about the layers and organization of the OSI model, which provides a framework for understanding how different network protocols work together.

- Different types of network: Understand the distinctions between LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network) networks in terms of their typical usage and geographical size.

- Internet and IP addresses: Explore the structure of the Internet and the significance of IP addresses, including the two types - public and private.

- IPv4 and IPv6: Discover the reasons behind the creation of IPv6 and its advantages over IPv4.

- TCP and UDP: Differentiate between the two most commonly used data transfer protocols for IP and understand their main differences.

- TCP/UDP ports list: Familiarize yourself with some of the well-known ports like SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS, and their corresponding numbers.

- What is ping/ICMP: Learn how the ping command and the ICMP protocol are used to check if a device is connected to a network.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics without the need for external assistance:

1. OSI Model: Understand the layers, organization, and purpose of the OSI model, which forms the basis of modern networking.

2. LAN and WAN: Define the concepts of LAN and WAN, including their typical usage and geographical sizes.

3. Internet and IP Addresses: Grasp the architecture of the Internet and the significance of IP addresses, both public and private.

4. IPv6: Understand the motivation behind the creation of IPv6 and its advantages compared to IPv4.

5. TCP and UDP: Differentiate between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and comprehend their primary differences.

6. Ports: Define what ports are and memorize some important port numbers for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.

7. Ping and ICMP: Explore how the ping command and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) are used to check device connectivity.

## Requirements

To successfully complete this project, you need to fulfill the following requirements:

- Use editors like vi, vim, or emacs for your Bash script files.

- Ensure that all your Bash script files are compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

- Add a new line at the end of all your files.

- Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder, providing essential information about the project.

- Make all your Bash script files executable.

- Pass shellcheck without any errors.

- Start each Bash script with the line `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.

- Begin the second line of each Bash script with a comment explaining the purpose of the script.

## Additional Information

To answer multiple-choice questions, simply type the number of the correct answer in your answer file, adding a new line for each new answer.

Now, let's embark on this networking journey together and deepen our understanding of how data travels across networks!
